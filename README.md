# **MovieGenius: Hybrid Movie Recommender System**

**MovieGenius** is a hybrid movie recommendation system leveraging content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks on the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). Built with Python and Streamlit, this project offers personalized, interactive movie suggestions through a clean and cinematic user interface.

---

## **Project Overview**

This system combines four recommendation methods to provide comprehensive movie suggestions:

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to the user's preferences based on genres and features.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses user-user similarities to predict individual tastes.
- **Matrix Factorization:** Models latent factors for accurate predictions.
- **Neural Network Model:** Captures complex user-item relationships to refine recommendations.

The app features a cinematic blurred background with a fixed image, stylish white bold text, and real-time recommendations.
